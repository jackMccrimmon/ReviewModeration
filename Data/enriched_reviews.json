{"user_id":"Camilla Sosa","rating":5,"review":"I\u2019ve had this case for about 3 months now and I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. Overall great quality, great price, and very cute. I\u2019ve been through three phones this year because I\u2019m 1. very clumsy but also 2. a super busy mom and I\u2019m always carrying a bunch of stuff in my hands so things (usually my phone) tend to fall. The edges on this case break the impact of the fall and have saved my phone a few times already. Super recommended.","language":"en","low_score":0,"high_score":1,"word_count":84,"anonymous":0,"flag_tally":0,"is_flagged":"---"}

{"user_id":"jpleakis","rating":4,"review":"Seems like it will protect the phone well during a fall. The material is a little more slippery plastic and a little less like a grippy rubber than I would have preferred, but a good, inexpensive case that still lets you show off your iPhone","language":"en","low_score":0,"high_score":1,"word_count":45,"anonymous":0,"flag_tally":0,"is_flagged":"---"}
{"user_id":"S.L. Wallis","rating":1,"review":"I literally couldn\u2019t hold my phone with this case because it\u2019s grip is terrible.

{"user_id":"Shadow","rating":5,"review":"Case feels good in your hands. There\u2019s a nice lip just over the edges to protect the screen. The buttons line up and register with the phone on the first tap. Cutout to silence phone is large enough to easily hit the switch. The previous case I purchased did not allow enough room to easily flick the switch if you don\u2019t have long nails. Clear case allows you to see the beautiful details of your device.","language":"en","low_score":0,"high_score":1,"word_count":76,"anonymous":0,"flag_tally":0,"is_flagged":"---"}
{"user_id":"Mamushka","rating":3,"review":"It\u2019s slightly protective, but the lip on the front is not raised enough to protect the screen. If it falls on its side it\u2019d be fine because of the awkward, bulky corners. There\u2019s a lot of better looking and functional cases out there for the same price.","language":"en","low_score":0,"high_score":1,"word_count":47,"anonymous":0,"flag_tally":0,"is_flagged":"---"}
{"user_id":"Dynamo","rating":1,"review":"I\u2019ve been using this case for only 1 week. And I always wash my hands and wipe my phone because of the pandemic and this phone case turned yellow even with me washing it with dish washing soap. I don\u2019t recommend this case.","language":"en","low_score":1,"high_score":0,"word_count":43,"anonymous":0,"flag_tally":0,"is_flagged":"---"}
{"user_id":"Mariah Reynolds","rating":4,"review":"I picked this case because I have a yellow phone and I wanted to see the yellow and not cover it up. I wish it came up more on the sides and covered the screen more, I fear if I drop it flat on my screen it's still at risk. The back and sides have good protection though. It doesn't cover the back camera much either so I had to by a cover for my camera because I noticed I could still hear it touching surfaces when I would place my phone down on the backside. It has first level durability so if your pretty safe with your phone this case will be alright but if your rough or accident prone get a different one.","language":"en","low_score":0,"high_score":1,"word_count":125,"anonymous":0,"flag_tally":0,"is_flagged":"---"}

{"user_id":"Mertz","rating":2,"review":"Seems like a sturdy enough case. I like the opaque clear color. The problem I\u2019m having is the case is loose and the phone comes out at the corners.

{"user_id":"Shelby H","rating":5,"review":"Case fits perfectly on iPhone 11 with tempered glass screen protector installed.
